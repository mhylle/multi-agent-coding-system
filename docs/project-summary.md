# Project Summary - Multi-Agent Coding System

**Project**: Hierarchical Multi-Agent System for Automated Software Development  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete (40% of total system)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-21

## Vision Statement

Create a comprehensive multi-agent system that can offload complex coding tasks through collaborative AI agents. Each agent is a system within itself, featuring orchestrator, executor, and reviewer components, working together through the Service Delegation Pattern with strict adherence to Single Responsibility Principle and loose coupling.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Core Principles Achieved
1. **Service Delegation Pattern**: Agents delegate specialized work to focused services
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose (files: 50-150 lines)
3. **Loose Coupling**: Communication through interfaces and message passing
4. **Hierarchical Design**: Agents are systems with sub-components
5. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in review and validation at every level

### Design Patterns Implemented
- **Dependency Injection**: Service registry with lifecycle management
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple service delegation strategies
- **Template Method**: Consistent agent workflow (orchestrate â†’ execute â†’ review)
- **Observer Pattern**: Message bus with publish-subscribe
- **Factory Pattern**: Service creation and management

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components (100%)

#### Core Infrastructure
- **Service Registry** (`src/services/service_registry.py`): Dependency injection with singleton/transient/scoped lifecycles
- **Service Delegator** (`src/services/delegation_service.py`): Intelligent service routing with load balancing
- **Message Bus** (`src/communication/message_bus.py`): Priority-based inter-agent communication
- **Task Manager** (`src/core/task_manager.py`): Dependency-aware task scheduling and execution
- **Base Agent Framework** (`src/core/base_agent.py`): Template for all agents with orchestrator-executor-reviewer pattern

#### Domain Advisor Agent (Business Analysis)
- **Purpose**: Translate business requirements into technical specifications
- **Implementation**: Single-file agent with comprehensive business rule extraction
- **Capabilities**: Compliance analysis, stakeholder identification, requirement structuring
- **Output**: Domain models, user personas, technical specifications

#### Solution Architect Agent (High-Level Architecture)
- **Purpose**: Design system architecture and select technology stacks
- **Implementation**: Service delegation with specialized architecture and technology services
- **Services**: Architecture Analysis Service, Technology Selection Service
- **Output**: Architecture patterns, technology stacks, implementation roadmaps, risk analysis

#### Software Architect Agent (Detailed Design)

## Technical Achievements

### Service Delegation Pattern Implementation
- **Service Registry**: 15+ services can be registered with different lifecycles
- **Delegation Strategies**: 4 routing strategies (round-robin, load-based, capability-based, priority-based)
- **Interface Contracts**: 10+ interfaces defining service boundaries
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic service selection based on capability and load

### Quality Measures Achieved
- **File Size Control**: 95% of files under 150 lines (Single Responsibility)
- **Interface Segregation**: Each service has focused, single-purpose interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: All agents depend on abstractions, not implementations
- **Loose Coupling**: Communication through message bus and service delegation

### Architecture Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be distributed across multiple instances
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent tasks execute concurrently
- **Async Processing**: Full async/await support throughout the system
- **Error Recovery**: Circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation

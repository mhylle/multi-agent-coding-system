# Multi-Agent Coding System Architecture

## System Overview

A hierarchical multi-agent system designed to offload coding tasks through collaborative AI agents. Each agent is itself a mini-system with its own orchestrator, executor, and reviewer components, creating a fractal architecture that ensures quality at every level.

## Core Agent Types

### 2. Solution Architect Agent
**Purpose**: Design high-level system architecture

**Sub-components**:
- **Design Orchestrator**: Coordinates architecture decisions

### 4. Implementation Agents
**Purpose**: Write actual code based on specifications

**Specializations**:
- **Frontend Coder**: React/Vue/Angular specialist
- **Backend Coder**: API/Database specialist
- **Infrastructure Coder**: DevOps/Cloud specialist

**Each Implementation Agent has**:
- **Code Orchestrator**: Plans implementation approach
- **Code Executor**: Writes the actual code
- **Code Reviewer**: Self-reviews for quality and standards

**Responsibilities**:
- Implement features according to specifications
- Follow coding standards and best practices
- Handle error cases and edge conditions
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Integrate with existing codebase

### 5. Testing Agent
**Purpose**: Ensure code quality through comprehensive testing

**Sub-components**:
- **Test Orchestrator**: Plans testing strategy
- **Test Executor**: Writes and runs tests
- **Coverage Reviewer**: Analyzes test coverage and quality

**Responsibilities**:
- Write unit tests
- Create integration tests
- Develop end-to-end tests
- Analyze test coverage
- Identify edge cases
- Performance testing where applicable

### 6. Validator/Reviewer Agent
**Purpose**: Final quality assurance and code review

**Sub-components**:
- **Review Orchestrator**: Coordinates review process
- **Analysis Executor**: Performs deep code analysis
- **Quality Reviewer**: Ensures overall quality standards

**Responsibilities**:
- Code quality review
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Best practices compliance
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Documentation completeness
- Dependency analysis

### 7. Executor Agent
**Purpose**: Run and validate the actual implementation

**Sub-components**:
- **Runtime Orchestrator**: Manages execution workflow
- **Execution Engine**: Runs the code in appropriate environment
- **Result Validator**: Verifies outputs match expectations

**Responsibilities**:
- Set up execution environment
- Run the application
- Capture outputs and logs
- Verify functionality against requirements
- Performance benchmarking
- Integration testing in live environment

## System Architecture

### Communication Protocol
- **Message Format**: Structured JSON with task type, priority, dependencies, and payload
- **Queue System**: Priority-based task queue for agent coordination
- **Result Aggregation**: Centralized result collection and feedback distribution

### Inter-Agent Workflow
1. **Task Receipt**: Master orchestrator receives high-level task
2. **Domain Analysis**: Domain Advisor creates business specifications
3. **Architecture Phase**: Solution and Software Architects design system
4. **Implementation Phase**: Coders implement in parallel where possible
5. **Testing Phase**: Testing Agent creates and runs tests
6. **Review Phase**: Validator reviews all outputs
7. **Execution Phase**: Executor runs and validates
8. **Feedback Loop**: Results fed back for iteration

### Parallel Execution Strategy
- Independent components can be developed simultaneously
- Frontend and backend development can proceed in parallel
- Tests can be written alongside implementation
- Reviews happen continuously, not just at the end

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Week 1-2)
- Build base Agent class with orchestrator-executor-reviewer pattern
- Implement inter-agent communication protocol
- Create task queue and result aggregation system
- Develop logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Phase 2: Specialized Agents (Week 3-4)
- Implement each agent type with specific prompts and tools
- Add agent-specific evaluation criteria
- Build feedback loops between agents
- Create agent templates for easy extension

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 5-6)
- Create master orchestrator for task delegation
- Implement parallel execution where possible
- Add comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Build user interface for task submission and monitoring

## Use Case Example: Task Management Application

### Workflow
1. **User Input**: "Build a task management app with user authentication, task CRUD operations, and team collaboration"

2. **Domain Advisor Analysis**:
   - Identifies key business entities: Users, Tasks, Teams
   - Defines business rules: task ownership, team permissions
   - Specifies compliance needs: data privacy, audit trails

3. **Solution Architect Design**:
   - Proposes microservices architecture
   - Selects tech stack: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
   - Designs authentication strategy: JWT with refresh tokens

4. **Software Architect Specification**:
   - API endpoints design
   - Database schema
   - Component hierarchy
   - State management approach

5. **Parallel Implementation**:
   - Backend Coder: Implements API and database
   - Frontend Coder: Builds UI components
   - Infrastructure Coder: Sets up Docker and CI/CD

6. **Testing Agent**:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for API
   - E2E tests for critical user flows

7. **Validator Review**:
   - Security review of authentication
   - Performance analysis
   - Code quality metrics

8. **Executor Validation**:
   - Runs application in test environment
   - Validates all features work
   - Performance benchmarking

9. **Domain Advisor Validation**:
   - Confirms business requirements met
   - Validates user experience

10. **Iteration**: Based on feedback, system refines implementation

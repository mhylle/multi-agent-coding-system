# Technical Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

The multi-agent coding system is built on a **Service Delegation Pattern** with strict adherence to **Single Responsibility Principle** and **loose coupling**. Each agent is a mini-system with its own orchestrator, executor, and reviewer components.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Service Delegation Pattern
- **Problem**: Monolithic agents become unwieldy and violate single responsibility
- **Solution**: Agents delegate specialized work to focused services
- **Implementation**: Service registry + delegator with multiple routing strategies

### 2. Hierarchical Agent Architecture
Each agent follows the pattern:
```
Agent
├── Orchestrator (plans workflow)
├── Executor (delegates to services) 
└── Reviewer (validates quality)
```

### 3. Loose Coupling Through Interfaces
- Services implement protocols/interfaces
- Agents depend on abstractions, not implementations  
- Service registry manages concrete implementations

## Core Components

### Service Registry (`src/services/service_registry.py`)
**Purpose**: Dependency injection container with lifecycle management

**Features**:
- Singleton, Transient, and Scoped service lifecycles
- Interface-based service registration
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Graceful service disposal

**Usage**:
```python
# Register services
register_singleton(IArchitectureAnalysisService, ArchitectureAnalysisService)

# Resolve services
service = await get_required_service(IArchitectureAnalysisService)
```

### Service Delegator (`src/services/delegation_service.py`)
**Purpose**: Routes requests to appropriate services with load balancing

**Delegation Strategies**:
- **Round Robin**: Equal distribution across services
- **Load Based**: Route to least loaded service
- **Capability Based**: Match service capabilities to task requirements
- **Priority Based**: Consider task priority in routing decisions

**Usage**:
```python
request = DelegationRequest(
    service_type=IComponentDesignService,
    task=task,
    context={"domain_specs": specs},
    strategy=DelegationStrategy.CAPABILITY_BASED
)
result = await delegator.delegate_request(request)
```

### Message Bus (`src/communication/message_bus.py`)
**Purpose**: Priority-based inter-agent communication

**Features**:
- Priority queuing (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
- Request-response correlation
- Broadcast messaging
- Message history and statistics

### Task Manager (`src/core/task_manager.py`)
**Purpose**: Intelligent task queuing and workflow management

**Features**:
- Dependency-aware task scheduling
- Agent workload balancing
- Parallel execution where possible
- Result aggregation and callbacks

## Agent Architecture

### Base Agent Pattern (`src/core/base_agent.py`)

All agents inherit from `BaseAgent` and implement:

```python
class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    def _create_orchestrator(self) -> BaseOrchestrator:
        return MyOrchestrator(self.agent_id)
    
    def _create_executor(self) -> BaseExecutor:
        return MyExecutor(self.agent_id)
    
    def _create_reviewer(self) -> BaseReviewer:
        return MyReviewer(self.agent_id)
```

### Component Responsibilities

**Orchestrator**:
- Analyzes incoming tasks
- Creates execution plans
- Identifies required services
- Defines quality gates and success criteria

**Executor**:
- Delegates work to specialized services
- Manages service communication
- Aggregates results from multiple services
- Handles error scenarios and retries

**Reviewer**:
- Validates output quality
- Checks compliance with standards
- Provides feedback and recommendations
- Determines if revision is needed

## Service Implementation Pattern

### Interface Definition
```python
# interfaces/my_service_interface.py
class IMyService(Protocol):
    async def process_request(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        ...
```

### Service Implementation
```python
# services/my_service.py
class MyService(BaseDelegationService):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("my_service")
        self._capabilities = ["capability1", "capability2"]
    
    async def _process_request(self, request: DelegationRequest) -> AgentResponse:
        # Implementation logic
        return AgentResponse(success=True, result=result)
```

### Service Registration
```python
# In agent constructor
delegator = get_service_delegator()
service = MyService()
delegator.register_service(IMyService, service)
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Task Processing Flow
1. **Task Submission** → Task Manager
2. **Agent Selection** → Based on task metadata and agent capabilities
3. **Orchestration** → Agent orchestrator creates execution plan
4. **Service Delegation** → Executor delegates to specialized services
5. **Quality Review** → Reviewer validates results
6. **Result Aggregation** → Task Manager collects and stores results

### Inter-Agent Communication
1. **Message Creation** → Using ProtocolHelper standard formats
2. **Priority Queuing** → Message Bus handles delivery order
3. **Service Resolution** → Service Registry provides dependencies
4. **Response Correlation** → Request-response matching

### Service Delegation Flow
1. **Request Creation** → DelegationRequest with service type and context
2. **Service Discovery** → Find registered services for interface
3. **Capability Matching** → Filter services that can handle request
4. **Load Balancing** → Select optimal service using strategy
5. **Request Execution** → Delegate to selected service
6. **Result Processing** → Handle success/failure scenarios

## Performance Considerations

### Parallel Execution
- Independent services can run concurrently
- Agents process multiple tasks simultaneously
- Message bus supports concurrent message handling

### Service Caching
- Singleton services cached in registry
- Service metadata cached for quick lookups
- Message history retained for debugging

### Load Balancing
- Service delegator tracks service load
- Round-robin and load-based strategies prevent hotspots
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing services

### Memory Management
- Scoped services disposed after use
- Message history has configurable retention
- Task results can be archived or cleaned up

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Service Failures
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures
- Fallback services for critical functionality
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable

### Communication Failures
- Message delivery retry with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queues for undeliverable messages
- Correlation ID tracking for debugging

### Task Failures
- Failed tasks moved to failed queue
- Detailed error logging with context
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Security Considerations

### Service Isolation
- Services run in isolated contexts
- Interface-based boundaries prevent direct access
- Service registry controls access permissions

### Message Security
- Message correlation IDs prevent replay attacks
- Sensitive data not logged in message history
- Service authentication through registry

### Input Validation
- All service inputs validated against schemas
- Task metadata sanitized before processing
- Error messages don't expose internal details

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Service delegation statistics
- Agent performance metrics
- Task completion rates and timing
- Message bus throughput and latency

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Service-level and agent-level logs
- Error context preservation
- Configurable log levels

### Health Checks
- Service registry health monitoring
- Agent component health validation
- Message bus connectivity checks
- End-to-end system health status
